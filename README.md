# Arduino-Brake-Rotor-Clock
Cool project for petrolheads that combines programming and electronics in the form of a brake rotor that contains a DS2321 RTC to display the time on an LED display.

Usage:
- Visit the Arduino project page for this and instructions on how to build this project along with a complete materials list.
- The software simply takes into account the data recieved by the DS2321 and displays it on the LED display.
- Download and run this code on any Arduino board with the correct SCL and SDA pair for larger boards
